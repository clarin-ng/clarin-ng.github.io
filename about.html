        <h3 class="oceanblue about-text">Hello! My name is Clarin Ng.</h3>
        <p class="intro"> I'm a UX Designer born in Hong Kong, resided in the San Francisco Bay Area. Becoming a UX Designer has been a long journey for me. I have found my place in a profession which ties my strengths and values together. I am passionate about solving problems through research, empathy, and design. To this day, I look for opportunities to grow as a creative thinker and problem solver. Outside of UX... I am a defender of the boba milk tea, mother of one dog, and an active food muncher.

        <p id="paragraph-btn"> - More About Me - </p>
        <div id="more-about-me">
        <p>
          While I was accomplishing my bachelor's degree in Food Science, I started to explore different things and two significant events: waitressing and attending a class called "Applied Sensory and Consumer Science," had made me realized my passion- understand people and solving their hard and interesting problems.


        </p>

        <p>  With this eager passion in mind, it helped me to get a job after college as a Sensory Scientist at a startup. During that time, I managed consumer data research and testings for companies, specialized in food and personal care products. I was able to communicate with consumers from different backgrounds, understanding what drives their liking and preference. This experience helped me a great deal to realize the importance of research and empathy for people and their needs.

        </p>

        <p> I was fortunate to work at a startup where I was exposed to multiple parts of the business and seeing how everything was build from scratch. Every day, I was learning, exploring, and growing. From all this experience, I knew I wanted to tackle more on design thinking and to link research with creating creative solutions.


        </p>
        <p>
           I started to investigate the best industry that combines all my passion, and I discovered UX/ UI design after talking with a friend. I felt confident that this was the area that I wanted to breakthrough. User experience design continued the perfect combination of my passion for analytical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity. Hence, I am currently learning more about UX Design through a design apprenticeship with Bloc. With my background in Consumer research, I truly believe that making an effort to understand users' goals and frustrations helps me become a better designer. I strive to give a positive impact on society with a deep passion for solving problems through empathy, research, and design."
